## Pet Shop API

This API is designed to support the front end Pet Shop, and is easily deployable both locally using LocalStack and to AWS using CloudFormation.

### Project Structure

- `packages/`: This directory contains the individual AWS Lambda functions, each one acting as an endpoint for the API.
    - E.g., the `users` lambda handles all requests related to users.
- `shared/`: Shared codebase that can be imported by any of the lambda functions. Useful for utility functions, common middleware, or shared configurations.
- `scripts/`: This directory contains automation scripts to help with bundling and deploying the lambdas.

### Requirements

- Node.js
- Typescript
- Yarn: Fast, reliable, and secure package management.
- AWS CLI: Command Line Interface to interact with AWS services.
- jq: Lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. (Used in the bundling script for JSON processing)
- LocalStack: (optional for local AWS testing)
- LocalStack AWS CLI: a thin wrapper around the aws command line interface for use with LocalStack.

**Note**: All requirements can be installed via Homebrew on macOS:

```bash
brew install node typescript yarn awscli jq localstack
pip3 install awscli-local
```

### Setting up

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

2. Set up husky (git hooks):

    ```bash
    yarn prepare
    ```

### Development

- **Linting**: Ensure code quality and style consistency.

    ```bash
    yarn lint          # Checks for linting errors
    yarn lint:fix      # Automatically fixes linting errors when possible
    ```

- **Testing**: Run tests across all packages.

    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```

- **Building**: Transpile the TypeScript code.

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

### Deployment

#### Local

We're currently working on integration with LocalStack for local deployments. Stay tuned!

To start the service locally:

```bash
yarn start:local
```

#### AWS

Our AWS deployments leverage CloudFormation for resource management. Each lambda function corresponds to an endpoint in our API Gateway.

1. **Building and Bundling**:

   Before deploying, we need to transpile our TypeScript code and bundle our lambdas. This ensures that each lambda function has all its dependencies included.

    ```bash
    yarn bundle
    ```

2. **Deploying to Development**:

    ```bash
    yarn deploy:dev
    ```

3. **Deploying to Production**:

   Ensure that you've tested your changes thoroughly before deploying to production.

    ```bash
    yarn deploy:prod
    ```
